# GearBox
With the materials and information given to us throughout the lectures, we created a website that demonstrates the fundamentals of Human Interface Computing.

# How to Run the website:
- Install python if you havent already: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Once python is installed, open your favorite IDE
- In the python terminal, type: pip install flask
- After Flask is installed, you must install 3 more items:
- - pip install flask_cors
- - pip install flask_login
- - pip install flask_wtf
- Once everything is installed, run 'app.py' and click the local hosting link in the terminal

# The GearBox website should be live in your web browser! Now you can explore the page
